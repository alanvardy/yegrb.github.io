<p><strong>YEGRB's mission is to grow the Ruby community in Edmonton.</strong></p>

<p>We'll achieve this growth by:<p>

<ul>
  <li><em>inspiring</em>, the community with the wonders of ruby</li>
  <li><em>sharing</em>, the ruby community's stories and success</li>
  <li><em>connecting</em>, the ruby community with each other and the community at large</li>
</ul>

<p>YEGRB began in 2009 as a monthly meetup of the local Ruby community. Since then the monthly meetup has expanded to include hackups and other community building events like BuildNight and the Rails Rumble. Our membership includes developers, designers, students, and entreprenuers in the Edmonton community. We see ourselves as leading the development community in Edmonton and always welcome new members of any interest or skill level.</p>
