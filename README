This repository contains the home page for YEGRB, the Edmonton Ruby User Group.

Development setup
===================

To setup an environment to develop and change the website just clone this repo and then:

    bundle install --binstubs

To build the static files which will deployed to the site we use a gem called Jekyll (https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). You can get Jekyll to rebuild the site using:

    bin/jekyll

You'll need to re-run this every time you change a layout or edit a post. Since this gets tedious very quickly you can arrange for Jekyll to watch and re-build the pages automatically using the --auto flag:

    bin/jekyll --auto

The static files are build into the _site folder, but if you want to serve them to the web browser jekyll can be run as a server:

    bin/jekyll --server --auto

This will serve the pages on port 4000, and automatically rebuild the site when files in _posts or _layouts change.


Deploying to yegrb.com
=======================

If you have permission to write to the YEGrb site repo then you can deploy your changes to http://yegrb.com using rake:

    bin/rake github_pages:publish
