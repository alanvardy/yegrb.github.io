This is a list of projects to work on at the hackup.  If you'd like your idea added to this list then send a message with your pitch!

<h3>tail.yegrb.com</h3>

Follow members of the Edmonton ruby community.  This would tie in to GitHub, Twitter, mercurial, etc and allow you to see which projects are popular or topical.

<h3>Ruby Jukebox</h3>

A simple jukebox for the hackups.  The playlist is controlled through a webapp, and let's users upload MP3's to play.  Songs could also be bumped up in the playlist or vetoed.

<h3>Ruby Job Board</h3>

Connect local ruby developers with jobs and open source projects.

<h3>yegrb.com</h3>

We're happy with the current yegrb.com infrastructure but could use some slicker graphics and layout.  Any takers?

<h3>Personnal finance site</h3>

A site that let's you upload and securely manage your financial data.  It will never be shared with other users but there could be a social factor that would allow the site to automatically catagories expenses and help you assess is you're living within your means.
