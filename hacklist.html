<h3>tail.yegrb.com</h3>

Follow members of the Edmonton ruby community.  This would tie in to GitHub, Twitter, mercurial, etc and allow you to see which projects are popular or topical.

<h3>Ruby Jukebox</h3>

A simple jukebox for the hackups.  The playlist is controlled through a webapp, and let's users upload MP3's to play.  Songs could also be bumped up in the playlist or vetoed.
