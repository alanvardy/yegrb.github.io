title: Nov 15th, 2011 Meetup Notes
---

Thanks to everyone that came out to this last meetup. We did something a bit different and had Derick Bailey in to talk about backbone.js. It worked great, and we're going to continue trying to get more speakers in to other events in the future. Let us know if there's anyone you'd like us to try to track down!

We also had a number of new faces out at the meetup. It's great to see new people coming out and remeber that all skill levels and experience are welcome.
