## T-Shirt Design Contest

Thanks to everyone that completed the t-shirt survey last week. We've got a good idea what people are looking for now, and are excited to announce a new contest to design the shirt!

We're looking for people to submit designs using the new logo. At next months meetup we'll announce the designs and launch a vote to select a winning design. _The designer of the winning shirt will get their own shirt paid for by the meetup._

Interested designers can [download a design package](/images/yegrb-logo.zip) which includes the official YEGrb colours, logo and style guides. Submit your designs as a PNG image to [tshirts@yegrb.com](mailto:tshirts@yegrb.com), via twitter [@yegrb](https://twitter.com/yegrb), or via our [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/b/116923764087972001994/) before our next meetup on March 20th.
