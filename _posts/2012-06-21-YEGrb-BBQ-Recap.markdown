With Tuesday's BBQ YEGrb, the Edmonton Ruby Meetup, celebrates the end of
another great year of events and meetups. We're going to keep running hackups
on the first monday of each month, and new meetings and events will kick off
again in September.

Thank-you to everyone that's come out to attend or participate in our events.
A special thank-you to all our speakers for the talks and ideas.

I'd also like to thank our sponsors, especially [Yardstick Software](http://getyardstick.com/) and [Burmis Studio](http://www.burmis.ca/) who have been generous supporters of the meetup over the past two years.
We'd also like to thank [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) for donating $750 worth of hosting prizes to
the BBQ, and [Manning](http://manning.com/) and [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/) for the generous donation of their books.

Enjoy your summer!
