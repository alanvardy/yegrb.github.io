RailsRumble Survey
--------------------

Over the last month we ran a survey to see how useful YEGRB's support was during the RailsRumble.  The results are out, and the executive summary is that teams found YEGRB provided good useful about the rumble, and publicity for their apps.  Teams didn't find YEGRB very useful for matchmaking or venue finding which is something we'll try to improve on next year.  The teams were also very happy with their performance, and YEGRB as a whole.  [Full results are online for your own analysis](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AixYdwrjR-5idENvODZQcmpmaWtVX1FKTHNPZnNtVVE&hl=en).

Thanks to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts and comments!
