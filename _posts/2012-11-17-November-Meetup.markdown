This month we've got an exciting line-up of speakers starting with [@kylefox](http://twitter.com/kylefox)
who will be discussing, "Building modular apps with Ruby & Amazon Web Services".
Up next [@markbennett](http://twitter.com/markbennett) is going to dive into the latest in Ruby concurrency and
explore, "Distributed actor patterns with Celluloid".

As always, they'll be pizza and drinks afterwards.

Anyone who can't make it is encourage to tune in to our live Hangout on our
