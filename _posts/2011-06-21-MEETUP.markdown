**WHEN**: July 21st @ 18:30  
**WHERE**: [8404 109 St NW, Edmonton, AB, Canada (Original Joes Varsity)](http://goo.gl/XRnmk)

This is the last meetup before we take a break until September. There are no presentations, instead this is a chance to share your thoughts about the past 10 months over drinks.

We'll also be doing some planning for next year. Come out, get involved and help us organize the meetup for the next year!
