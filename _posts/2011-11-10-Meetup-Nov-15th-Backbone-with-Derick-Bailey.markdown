We're excited to announce that [Derick Bailey](https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/116923764087972001994/101060306397560578875/about) will be joining us to do a short introduction to [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) followed by time for questions and answers.

Backbone.js is an exciting new JavaScript MVC library. It's small (less than 5 kb), simple, and works well with other lbiraries like jQuery. In the year since it was launched it's gained a passionate following.

Derick Bailey is an independent consultant, software developer, writer, blogger, speaker and technology leader in central Texas (north of Austin). He has been a professional software developer since the late 90's, and has been writing code since the late 80's. Derick has also written extensively about Backbone.js and is the author of the [backbone-memento](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.memento) and [backbone.modelbinding](https://github.com/derickbailey/backbone.modelbinding) libraries, as well as contributing back to the backbone project. He's also a very nice guy.

We're [taking questions for Derick in advance](https://www.google.com/moderator/?authuser=2#15/e=c9f4&t=c9f4.41). You can submit your own questions and vote for your favourite questions that have already been asked.
