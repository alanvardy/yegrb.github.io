To celebrate another year of Ruby meetups, we're having a wrap-up BBQ on Tuesday 19 June 2012 at 18:30. It's happening downtown at my house in Riverdale. There's lots of free parking on the street. For privacy reasons, the full-address will be mailed out after you've [RSVP'ed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDFzWDJ5eFhPZ0hXN0UwU0ZBcVFVUVE6MQ).

Burgers, hot dogs, and snacks will be provided. There will also be soft beverages. BYOB for anything harder. We'll have some music and activities to keep people occupied.
