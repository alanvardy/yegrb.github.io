**WHAT**: Monthly Meetup  
**WHERE**: Room 2-49, Computing Science Centre (CSC), University of Alberta  
**WHEN**: Tuseday October 18th at 18:30  

This month's meetup is a nice mix of beginner and more advanced topis. We'll have four lightning talks covering:

 * How to build a gem
 * Sending SMS messages from Ruby with Twilio
 * A recap of RubyConf 2011
 * An intro to Foreman and managing your apps processes with Procfiles

As always there will be coverage of the latest Ruby and developer news. We'll also have a special announcement of interest to all you JavaScript developers out there.

If you can't make it out for the meetup, join us afterwards for drinks at Original Joe's Varsity on the corner of 109th Street and 84th Ave.

Get more details, and contribute news and other notes [on our wiki](https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Oct-18th%2C-2011-Meetup).
