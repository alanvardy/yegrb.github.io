We've got lots of ideas for the upcoming year, but this is your chance to get involved and add some of your own. Be a part of YEGrb  and help grow Ruby and technology in Edmonton.

There will be free pizza (or equivalent) which we'll decide on once everyone shows up. Looking forward to seeing everyone again after the summer break!
