**WHERE**: Room #2-49, Computing Science Centre, Univeristy of Alberta ([map](http://www.campusmap.ualberta.ca/index.cfm?campus=1&sector=2&feature=25))

We've got lots of ideas for the upcoming year, but this is your chance to get involved and add some of your own. Be a part of YEGrb  and help grow Ruby and technology in Edmonton.

There will be free pizza (or equivalent) which we'll decide on once everyone shows up. Looking forward to seeing everyone again after the summer break!

**UPDATE**: We're going to run a Google+ Hangout during the meeting. It will be hosted by [Mark Bennett](https://plus.google.com/104431949275766772757/about), so please add him to Google+ to participate. [Invites to Google+ are available](https://plus.google.com/_/notifications/ngemlink?path=%2F%3Fgpinv%3D7GgcH58wMYI%3A1yQt4k78FQ8) for those of you without accounts.
