This past weekend was the RailsRumble, a non-stop 48-hour marathon of coding, design, and pizza (judging by some of the posts on Twitter.)  There were four teams from Edmonton competing, and they all managed to build some great looking and functional apps.

<h2 style="clear:both">Foos League</h2>

Warning! There will be no such thing as a friendly or casual foosball match once you have logged your first game in FooLeague.

Foosleague features global and league ladder ranking at both the individual and team levels. Live scoring (thanks Pusher) of games combined with twitter trash talk adds a whole new level to rivalries. Foosleague captures blow by blow data for full game history and statistics.

<h2 style="clear:both">Codebucks</h2>

Letifree.me is based on the idea of freecyling, freegiving, freesharing, etc. We wanted to offer a web portal that makes it easy to offer or find reusable items so that they can find a new owner, versus ending up in the landfill.

Typically these communities revolve around a mailing list. We want to open up the concept to the open web, where visitors can easily perform searches, see photos, and users have a public reputation built around their positive (or negative) trade history.
