''WHAT'': September 2013 Meetup  
''WHEN'': Tuesday September 17th at 19:00  
''WHERE'': StartupEdmonton  

Summer's over and it's the start of another exciting year of YEGrb meetups!

We're kicking off the year with a meetup all about the RailsRumble. Come prepared to share tips, project ideas, and to find teammates!

@MarkBennett will also be presenting the first of a three part series on GIS. In the first talk he'll be covering the basics of GIS and what you need to know before you start coding.

We're still looking for more speakers, so let us know if you're interested!

We're also excited to announce that we're moving the venue to StartupEdmonton. The UofA has been a great host, and we hope we can continue having events there in the future.

[RSVP via the StartupEdmonton Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/events/138173042/).
