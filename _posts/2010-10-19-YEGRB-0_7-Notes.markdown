RailsRumble
===========

Congratulations to all the teams that participated in the RailsRumble!  There were four teams competing and they all completing some great looking and funtional apps.  We've posted [profiles of each app](http://yegrb.com/2010/10/18/These-are-your-rumble-apps/) on the blog.

Public voting starts next week, but you can [register your RailsRumble account now](http://railsrumble.com/login) to participate in the judging.

*rumble teams now have a few minutes to demo their apps*

And now for today's surprise, Cam Linke has agreed to give each app a few minutes to demo at the next DemoCamp.  If you're interested in doing so please let me know.
