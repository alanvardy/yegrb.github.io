## Drinks

The best part of the night for many of our members is after the talks are done, when we head to RATT ([map](http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?q=room+at+the+top&cid=9814268264566469572)) for food and drinks. This month was no exception and Inkdit kindly supplied a round for the table. Thanks!
