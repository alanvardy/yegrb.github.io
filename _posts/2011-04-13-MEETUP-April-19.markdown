**WHAT: DevOps and Ruby**  
**WHEN: Tuesday April 19th @ 6:30 PM**  
**WHERE: Room B2, Computer Science Centre, University of Alberta**

At our 13th meetup, we're going to be talking about DevOps. According to Wikipedia,

"DevOps is an emerging set of principles, methods and practices for communication, collaboration and integration between software development (application/software engineering) and IT operations (systems administration/infrastructure) professionals." ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps))

We've got two speakers lined up to talk about their experience using two popular infrastructure automation tools.  First up is Fletcher Nichol ([@fnichol](http://twitter.com/fnichol)) who will be giving an in-depth look at using [Chef recipes](http://www.rubyinside.com/chef-tasty-server-configuraiton-2162.html) to provision your servers. Up next is Daniel Huckstep ([@darkhelmetlive](http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive)) who'll be teaching up how to "Manage your servers LIKE A BOSS with [fabric](https://github.com/bitprophet/fabric) and [puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet)"!

YEGRB is also starting a new series of talks where we’ll cover a basic Ruby or Rails skill. Called the Ruby Recap we’re taking [suggestions on Convore for the first topic](https://convore.com/yegrb/5-minute-ruby-newbie-questions/).

We’re also excited to announce that for the first time this meetup is taking place at the University of Alberta in the Computer Science Building. There are limited power outlets, so please bring a full charge for your mobile devices. **We'll be providing some pizza, so get there early if you want a slice.**
