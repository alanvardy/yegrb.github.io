Amir Barylko ([@abarylko](http://twitter.com/abarylko)) is joining us to guide a one hour deep dive into [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). Here's how Amir describes his talk:

> Capybara is a ruby gem that works as a complement of cucumber and aims to simplify writing acceptance tests for any web application. Out of the box it provides a DSL that makes writing steps for common functionality like following links, clicking buttons, etc.
> 
> It provides different drivers that can be configured and even chose per feature or scenario basis to indicate how we want to run that case. It has built-in support rack-test, Culerity, Celerity and Selenium.

**Please note that this meeting is taking place on Wednesday June 1st. Our regular meetups will return June 21st.**
