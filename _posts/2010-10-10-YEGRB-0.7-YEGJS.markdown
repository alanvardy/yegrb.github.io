This month we're taking a break from Ruby to talk about... JavaScript!

Javascript is a topic of interest to many Rubyists, and we decided that there's enough going on to warrant it's own meetup.

We've already got speakers talking about Node.js and TDD in Javascript, but there are lots of other things to cover. If you'd like to do a talk then contact @yegrb on Twitter or email mark@yegrb.com.

We're also still looking for a sponsor for this months meetup. Sponsoring a meetup is as cheap as $100 and ensures we can keep these meetups going at the current venue. Contact mark@yegrb.com if you're interested.

[RSVP to attend or do a lightning talk](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEpKWl9jVDFsUHNHa1lJaWRqLXlBVmc6MA). See you there!
