title: YEGRB website survey
---

We hope everyone is enjoying their holidays, and has started to get their New Years plans together!  Here at YEGrb we've been thinking about our new years resolutions and right at the top of the list is redesigning of our website to match [our new mission](https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Mission).

To better understand how you use the website, we've put together a short survey.  It should take about 10-minutes and as always your responses will be kept anonymous.  [Have your say](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dGVIdmg4QzFYaEMwS2I4d01HejJfeUE6MQ#gid=0) and watch for more exciting developments in the New Year!
