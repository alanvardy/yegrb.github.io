**WHERE**: IdeaLoft, 10355 105 St NW, Edmonton ([map](http://g.co/maps/er322))

Join us for our monthly hackup this coming Monday evening at IdeaLoft. We'll be ordering in pizza and writing code. Personal and work projects are welcome, and you don't even have to work in Ruby (though you'll get lots of help if you are!)

Don't forget we've also got our Christmas meetup happening a week earlier that normal on Tuesday Dec 13th. Help us but together our agenda, or register to talk on the [YEGrb wiki](https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Dec-13th%2C-2011-Meetup).
