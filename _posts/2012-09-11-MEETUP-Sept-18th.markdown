Summer is over, and we're back with a new year of Ruby meetups! We're also
excited to announce the arrival of another [RailsRumble this October 12th-14th](http://blog.railsrumble.com/)
and we want you to take part. In fact, we're going to dedicate this 
first meeting to preparing for the RailsRumble along with our standard
news features, and Ruby Recap.

We're also looking to spice things up with a few more speakers. If you have
a favourite gem, recent project, or Ruby talk you'd like to give let us know
by replying at [@yegrb on Twitter](http://twitter.com/yegrb), or sending an [email to mark@yegrb.com](mailto:mark@yegrb.com).

If you can't make it we'll also be broadcasting the meetup live again via a
Hangout on [our Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/b/116923764087972001994/116923764087972001994/posts).
