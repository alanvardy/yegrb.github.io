I hope you had a great summer, and are excited for another year of Ruby meetups!

Based on feedback from the [last planning meeting](https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Planning-meeting-2), event planning is becoming more collaborative. Check out our [meetup planning page on the YEGrb wiki](https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Sept-20th%2C-2011-Meetup) where you can:

* sign up to talk
* suggest questions to be answered during the Ruby Recap
* add the latest Ruby news
* share your contact details with other attendees

After the meetup is over, we'll head out to [RATT in SUB](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/131/1437395/restaurant/Room-at-the-Top-Ratt-Edmonton) for some food and beverages. You're welcome to meet us there whether you've been able to attend the talks or not.

I'm going to be out of town for this first meetup, but Sean Ouimet has kindly stepped up to run the show. I'll see everyone again in October.
