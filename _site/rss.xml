<p>Our next meetup is taking place on May 17th, 2011 at the Computer Science Centre on the University of Alberta campus.</p>
<h2>Ruby Refresh with <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkBennett">@MarkBennett</a></h2>
<p>In this months recap we talked about Rack, and it&#8217;s role in the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Iterative Chef by <a href="http://twitter.com/fnichol">@fnichol</a></h2>
<p>Fletcher Nichol gave an in-depth talk on bootstrapping a solo box with Chef. He started by using standard shell scripts to configure his box, and slowly iterated his examples to leverage more Chef best practices. He&#8217;s kindly posted <a href="http://fnichol.github.com/iterative_chef/">his complete notes</a> on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Puppet by <a href="http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive">@darkhelmetlive</a></h2>
<p>Daniel Huckstep finished the night with a discussion of using Puppet for automated server management. The repo he used for deployment is private so despite the fact that he used it as an example, he can&#8217;t open it up. If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about Puppet he suggests visiting <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs</a> and <a href="http://fabfile.org/">FabFile</a>. The puppet docs are also pretty solid.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHAT: DevOps and Ruby</strong><br /><strong>WHEN: Tuesday April 19th @ 6:30 PM</strong><br /><strong>WHERE: Room B2, Computer Science Centre, University of Alberta</strong></p>

<p>At our 13th meetup, we&#8217;re going to be talking about DevOps. According to Wikipedia,</p>

<p>&#8220;DevOps is an emerging set of principles, methods and practices for communication, collaboration and integration between software development (application/software engineering) and IT operations (systems administration/infrastructure) professionals.&#8221; (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps'>link</a>)</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve got two speakers lined up to talk about their experience using two popular infrastructure automation tools. First up is Fletcher Nichol (<a href='http://twitter.com/fnichol'>@fnichol</a>) who will be giving an in-depth look at using <a href='http://www.rubyinside.com/chef-tasty-server-configuraiton-2162.html'>Chef recipes</a> to provision your servers. Up next is Daniel Huckstep (<a href='http://twitter.com/darkhelmetlive'>@darkhelmetlive</a>) who&#8217;ll be teaching up how to &#8220;Manage your servers LIKE A BOSS with <a href='https://github.com/bitprophet/fabric'>fabric</a> and <a href='https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet'>puppet</a>&#8221;!</p>

<p>YEGRB is also starting a new series of talks where we’ll cover a basic Ruby or Rails skill. Called the Ruby Recap we’re taking <a href='https://convore.com/yegrb/5-minute-ruby-newbie-questions/'>suggestions on Convore for the first topic</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also excited to announce that for the first time this meetup is taking place at the University of Alberta in the Computer Science Building. There are limited power outlets, so please bring a full charge for your mobile devices. <strong>We&#8217;ll be providing some pizza, so get there early if you want a slice.</strong></p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thank-you for taking the time to come out to Edmonton&#8217;s very first BuildNight. There was a great turnout and hopefully you enjoyed yourselves!</p>

<p>YEGRB really appreciated being given the opportunity to run the first event, and we&#8217;re excited to see what builds people come up with next. We&#8217;re often asked questions about how to get started with Rails and events like last night are a great way to do that. If you&#8217;re interested in carrying on with Ruby and Rails consider coming out to our next meetup. They&#8217;re always on the third Tuesday of every month. Details and location will be announced a few weeks ahead via the <a href='https://twitter.com/yegrb'>@yegrb twitter account</a>, through <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yegrb'>our mailing list</a>, and on our blog at <a href='http://yegrb.com'>http://yegrb.com</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/buildnight'>source code from last nights talk is available on GitHub</a> for you to explore. Our instructions for <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Installing-Ruby'>installing Ruby</a> and <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Introduction-to-Ruby'>getting started with Ruby</a> and <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Introduction-to-Rails'>Rails</a> are also always available on <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki'>our wiki</a>, were they are continually updated by our members. For more advanced developers we&#8217;ve also got a list of our favourite gems, books, blogs and other references on <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Ruby-resources'>our Ruby resources page</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re always looking to improve, so if you have time please <a href='https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?formkey=dERKSkRFY25ZUW5pNTRhR3FfSDZUa1E6MQ'>spare a few minutes to answer a quick survey</a> about last nights event. It&#8217;s a simple way to contribute and will really help us understand what you&#8217;re looking for from future BuildNights and from your Ruby meetup in general.</p>

<p>Once again a big thank-you to Cam Linke from <a href='http://www.startupedmonton.com'>StartupEdmonton</a> for getting these BuildNights rolling, the <a href='https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/'>Department of Computer Science</a> for supplying the venue, and to <a href='http://www.yardsticksoftware.com/'>Yardstick Software</a> for supplying everyone&#8217;s dinnerr.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> YEGRB 1.0 BuildNight<br /><strong>WHEN:</strong> Tuesday March 15th @ 18:30<br /><strong>WHERE:</strong> University of Alberta, Computer Science Building (<a href='http://www.campusmap.ualberta.ca/index.cfm?campus=1&amp;sector=2&amp;feature=25'>map</a>)</p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that in partnership with <a href='http://www.startupedmonton.com/'>Startup Edmonton</a>, YEGRB is hosting the first every <a href='http://buildnightedmonton.eventbrite.com/'>BuildNight</a> at the University of Alberta Computer Science Building on Tuesday March 15th. Over the course of two hours you&#8217;ll eat pizza and watch as we use <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> to build a web application from scratch! Afterwards we&#8217;ll make the source code available through our <a href='https://github.com/yegrb'>GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone interesting in coming needs to <a href='http://buildnightedmonton.eventbrite.com/'>get a ticket</a>. They&#8217;re free, but are limited to 25 spots.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re encouraged to bring your own computer to follow along with us as we go. No past Ruby or Rails experience is neccesary, though some basic programming understanding will help you keep up as we won&#8217;t be able to take questions during the build. To get setup we encourage you to visit out wiki for detailed <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Installing-Ruby'>Ruby installation instructions</a>, and for a quick <a href='https://github.com/yegrb/yeg-wiki/wiki/Ruby-resources'>introduction to Ruby and Rails</a>. There will also be a swarm of experienced local Ruby developers on hand throughout the night to help install Ruby and Rails, and to answer questions. You can also get help anytime from <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yegrb'>our mailing list</a> and on <a href='http://twitter.com/yegrb'>Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking for a few more experience Rails developers to be on hand during the event. If you&#8217;d like to help out please send an email to <a href='mailto:mark@yegrb.com'>mark@yegrb.com</a>.</p>

<p>A big thanks goes out to the <a href='https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/'>University of Alberta Computer Science Department</a> for supplying the space, and to <a href='http://www.yardsticksoftware.com/'>Yardstick Software</a> for kindly donating the pizza.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This last meetup was different from normal, as we led a series of small group discussions about the tools and tricks people used to make developing with Ruby more enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id='editors'>Editors</h2>

<p>Most of the groups spent a lot of time discussing their favourite editors with <a href='http://www.vim.org/'>vim</a> and <a href='http://macromates.com/'>TextMate</a> taking the lead. Other popular editors included <a href='http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/'>gedit</a> on Ubuntu Linux and <a href='http://notepad-plus-plus.org/'>Notepad++</a> for Windows. <a href='http://code.google.com/p/macvim/'>MacVim</a> and <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'>emacs</a> where also mentioned.</p>

<p>Vim was singled out as a popular editor amongst our members. Most people were using a combination of different vim plugins including <a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails'>vim-rails</a>, <a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen'>pathogen</a>, <a href='https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree'>NERDTree</a>, <a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround'>vim-surround</a>, <a href='https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim'>jslint</a> and <a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=610'>ctags.vim</a>. Some of the members also publish the contents of their ~/.vim folders on GitHub for you to fork and make your own (<a href='https://github.com/fnichol/dotvim'>Fletcher</a> and <a href='https://github.com/MarkBennett/MarkBennett-vim'>Mark</a>). Peepcode also offers a pair (<a href='http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i'>part i</a> and <a href='http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-ii'>part ii</a>) of excellent screencasts which are well worth the $12 if you&#8217;re looking to learn vim quickly. The screencasts also come with an excellent sample ~/.vim folder which is used throughout.</p>

<p>In TextMate many people also mentioned the Command-T keyboard shortcut for searching files and code. <a href='http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen'>Peepopen</a> was also recommended as a navigation plugin for TextMate that also works well with MacVim and other Mac editors.</p>

<h2 id='deployment'>Deployment</h2>

<p>The topic of deployment was also raised with <a href='https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano'>Capistrano</a> remaining the hands-down favourite. <a href='http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html'>Vlad the deployer</a> and <a href='https://github.com/mislav/git-deploy'>git-deploy</a> also got honourable mentions.</p>

<h2 id='documentation'>Documentation</h2>

<p>For daily reference members recommended <a href='http://rdoc.info/'>rdoc.info</a> and <a href='http://railsapi.com/'>railsapi.com</a>. The official <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/'>Rails Guides</a> were available for more detailed Rails tutorials. For screencasts members turned to <a href='http://railscasts.com/'>Railscasts</a>, <a href='http://peepcode.com/screencasts/'>Peepcode</a>, <a href='http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts'>PragProg</a> and <a href='http://ruby.railstutorial.org/'>The Ruby of Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl</a>. <a href='http://railsforzombies.org/'>Rails for Zombies</a> was also mentioned as fun way to learn Ruby on Rails.</p>

<h2 id='testing'>Testing</h2>

<p>Most members use either <a href='http://rspec.info/'>rspec</a> or <a href='http://rdoc.info/stdlib/minitest/1.9.2/frames'>minitest</a> for their tests, along with various complementary tools like <a href='https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl'>factory-girl</a>, <a href='https://github.com/notahat/machinist'>machinist</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/floehopper/mocha'>mochra</a>. The <a href='http://rubygems.org/gems/autotest'>autotest gem</a> from <a href='http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/'>ZenTest</a> was also mentioned as an important tool for automatically running tests. <a href='https://github.com/mynyml/watchr'>Watchr</a> is another tool which can be used to run your tests automatically, though no one at the meetup is using it.</p>

<h2 id='other_tips'>Other tips</h2>

<p>Some members use a terminal emulation client called <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/'>screen</a> to maintain a persistent console on their servers. You can detach from screen terminal sessions, leaving them running while you disconnect from the server. This is great for managing long running server processes. Screen sessions also persist if your accidently disconnected, making them an essential tool for managing flaky internet connections. Scott is an avid screen user and has shared his <a href='https://gist.github.com/830499'>.screenrc</a>.</p>

<p>Mark was the sole <a href='http://tmux.sourceforge.net/'>tmux</a> user, preferring it to screen as it allows multiple users to share a session. It also lets you split a window vertically and horizontally which can&#8217;t be done in screen. He uses tmux for remote pair programming, and for running autotest in a split below his editor.</p>

<p>Fletcher is a fanatic about versioning and sharing his configuration, Mac users should look at his <a href='https://groups.google.com/d/msg/yegrb/-kX_0LJxI4o/TnDdhJqnEooJ'>post with details of all this GitHub repositories</a> on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Speaking of the <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yegrb'>mailing list</a>, if you don&#8217;t already you should <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yegrb'>sign up</a> to stay in touch with the meetup between events. It&#8217;s also a great way to get help when you&#8217;re stuck on a tough problem. Just be sure to include a link to your code if you&#8217;re look for help on something specific!</p>

<h2 id='next_meetup'>Next Meetup</h2>

<p>Our next meetup is on March 15th, the third tuesday in March. We&#8217;re not ready to announce details yet, but trust us when we say we&#8217;re planning something special.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> YEGRB 0.10 Work Smarter<br /><strong>WHEN:</strong> Tuesday February 15th @ 18:30<br /><strong>WHERE:</strong> Original Joes Varsity, 8404 109 Street (<a href='http://goo.gl/maps/YJNv'>map</a>)</p>

<p>The only code that counts is the code you ship.</p>

<p>At this meetup we&#8217;re going to be talking about the tools, tricks, and techniques that you use to write and ship your code. It&#8217;s going to run a little differently than our normal meetups. Rather than doing a series of presentations we&#8217;ll be breaking into groups to talk about your development workflow. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops and demonstrate their favorite coding techniques. After some discussion members will be invited to take the stage and share their favorite workflows with the group.</p>

<p>As with last meetup, we&#8217;re getting together at Original Joe&#8217;s Varsity close to the U of A campus (<a href='http://goo.gl/maps/YJNv'>8404 109 Street</a>). Come early to get a good seat, the meetup will get started at 6:30.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also looking for someone to sponsor part of the tab. Email mark@yegrb.com or reply to @yegrb on Twitter if you&#8217;re interested.</p>]]></description>

<h3>Jobs</h3>
<p><a href="http://tv.smibs.com/">Smibs.tv</a> is looking for a Ruby developer to perform various work on their site.  Contact <a href="mailto:peter@smibs.com">Peter Urban</a> for details and let him know you heard about the job at YEGrb.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>The theme for this month&#8217;s meetup was &#8220;New Year, New Languages&#8221; and our speakers took that to heart.</p>
<p>First up was @MarkBennett talking about creating objects and inheriting properties with JavaScript&#8217;s prototypicial inheritence.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/present/embed?id=dd46ntfw_443k3mb8gk&amp;interval=30&amp;size=m" frameborder="0" width="555" height="451"></iframe></p>
<p>Next was @fnichol who came through with an interesting look at <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, or as he called <a href="http://yegrb-groovy-talk.heroku.com/">A Java Head&#8217;s Gateway Drug to Ruby</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://yegrb-groovy-talk.heroku.com/" frameborder="0" width="555" height="451"></iframe></p>
<p>@darkhelmetlive followed up with a great dive into the language every Rubyist loves to hate, Python. After reading <a href="https://gist.github.com/783894">his notes on GitHub</a> you might not be so quick to knock Python at the next meetup.</p>
<p>@scottbrooksca finished off the evening by blowing everyone&#8217;s minds with a discussion of Erlang.  With it&#8217;s message passing and fail first philosphy it was a stretch, but he had everyone on his side by the time he was done!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0AdRNBjEirQHuZGNrNWo4bWJfNmd3bXRqMmZ3&hl=en&authkey=CPfk01Q" frameborder="0" width="555" height="451"></iframe></p>
<h3>Next meetup</h3>
<p>The next meetup is going to be happening on Feb 15th.  We&#8217;re talking about development workflows.  What&#8217;s your editor of choice? Console or db tools? Do you autotest or use rake to run tests?  We want to know all your favourite productivity tricks!</p>
<p>To prepare we&#8217;re asking all members to post a picture or video of your development setup and send a link to us @yegrb on Twitter.  We&#8217;ll share these at the meetup and have a guided discussion over drinks.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone for a great meetup last night!</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> YEGRB 0.9 - New Year, New Languages<br /><strong>WHEN:</strong> Tuesday Jan 18th @ 18:30<br /><strong>WHERE:</strong> Original Joe&#8217;s Varsity (<a href='http://goo.gl/maps/Rqdv'>map</a>)</p>

<p>Our first meetup of 2011 is happening this coming Tuesday at Original Joe&#8217;s Varsity. As announced at the last meetup we&#8217;re talking new languages for the new year. There will be a short set of lightning talks, then lots of time for socializing afterwards. And since we&#8217;re at a pub already, there&#8217;s no need to migrate anywhere once the talks are done. Even better there&#8217;s a bar tab!</p>

<p>The languages we&#8217;ll be presenting include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erlang (@scottbrooksca)</li>

<li>Python (@darkhelmetlive)</li>

<li>Groovy (@fnichol)</li>

<li>JavaScript (@MarkBennett)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to talk reply to @yegrb on Twitter or send us an email to mark@yegrb.com.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also looking for a projector. If you&#8217;ve got one we can use please email mark@yegrb.com.</p>]]></description>

<h2 id='railsrumble_survey'>RailsRumble Survey</h2>

<p>Over the last month we ran a survey to see how useful YEGRB&#8217;s support was during the RailsRumble. The results are out, and the executive summary is that teams found YEGRB provided good useful about the rumble, and publicity for their apps. Teams didn&#8217;t find YEGRB very useful for matchmaking or venue finding which is something we&#8217;ll try to improve on next year. The teams were also very happy with their performance, and YEGRB as a whole. <a href='https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AixYdwrjR-5idENvODZQcmpmaWtVX1FKTHNPZnNtVVE&amp;hl=en'>Full results are online for your own analysis</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: Please note this is now at 19:00. We&#8217;re also still looking for speakers!</strong></p>

<h1 id='the_details'>THE DETAILS:</h1>

<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: 16-Nov-2010 at 19:00 <strong>WHERE</strong>: <a href='http://goo.gl/XOrd'>Room 607, Stanley Milner Library, 7 Sir Winston Churchill Square</a></p>

<p>This month, we&#8217;re getting back to our roots to talk about the recent release of Rails 3.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking for speakers to discuss anything and everything related to Rails 3. Ideas for talks include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing Rails 3 and creating your first app</li>

<li>Upgrading a Rails 2.3 app to Rails 3</li>

<li>Integrating your existing gems with Rails 3</li>

<li>Rails 3 routing</li>

<li>AREL and the new ActiveRecord</li>

<li>Testing Rails 3 apps with rspec</li>

<li>Integrating Rails 3 with other rack applications</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t done a lightning talk at YEGRB before, now is your change to give it a try! They&#8217;re only 10-minutes and it&#8217;s a great experience. Sign up to talk using the RSVP form below.</p>

<p>Daniel (@darkhelmetlive) has also kindly volunteered to MC this month&#8217;s meetup. Please don&#8217;t give him too much of a hard time as this is his first time running the show. I won&#8217;t be there in person, but I will deliver a screen cast on Rails 3 remotely.</p>

<h1 id='important'>IMPORTANT:</h1>

<p>Please note that we&#8217;re having this meetup at the <a href='http://goo.gl/XOrd'>Stanley Milner Public Library</a>. There&#8217;s parking in the library parkade, and you can access the library building from Churchill LRT station, or from the bus terminal at the front entrance. The meetup is on level 6, room #7. We&#8217;ll post signs at the door on the night of the event. It&#8217;s a new venue for us, and we&#8217;d appreciate any feedback you may have.</p>

<h1 id='rsvp'>RSVP:</h1>

<p><a href='http://goo.gl/t6yj'>Use this form to RSVP</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This past weekend was the RailsRumble, a non-stop 48-hour marathon of coding, design, and pizza (judging by some of the posts on Twitter.) There were four teams from Edmonton competing, and they all managed to build some great looking and functional apps.</p>
<h2 style='clear:both'>Foos League</h2><img alt='Foos League Screenshot' src='/images/posts/2010/10/foos_screenshot.png' style='float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0' />
<p>Warning! There will be no such thing as a friendly or casual foosball match once you have logged your first game in FooLeague.</p>

<p>Foosleague features global and league ladder ranking at both the individual and team levels. Live scoring (thanks Pusher) of games combined with twitter trash talk adds a whole new level to rivalries. Foosleague captures blow by blow data for full game history and statistics.</p>

<p><a href='http://railsrumble.com/teams/foos-league'>Team page</a> <a href='http://foosleague.r10.railsrumble.com/'>The App</a> <a href='http://assets.bigleaguestudios.com/foosleague_tour.mov'>Screencast</a></p>
<h2 style='clear:both'>Codebucks</h2><img alt='Letitfree.me Screenshot' src='/images/posts/2010/10/letitfreeme_screenshot.png' style='float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0' />
<p>Letifree.me is based on the idea of freecyling, freegiving, freesharing, etc. We wanted to offer a web portal that makes it easy to offer or find reusable items so that they can find a new owner, versus ending up in the landfill.</p>

<p>Typically these communities revolve around a mailing list. We want to open up the concept to the open web, where visitors can easily perform searches, see photos, and users have a public reputation built around their positive (or negative) trade history.</p>

<p><a href='http://railsrumble.com/teams/codebucks'>Team page</a> <a href='http://letitfreeme.r10.railsrumble.com/'>The App</a></p>
<h2 style='clear:both'>Proc, Block and Two Smoking Lambdas</h2><img alt='GemRage Screenshot' src='/images/posts/2010/10/gemrage_screenshot.png' style='float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0' />
<p>GemRage scans your installed gems and Gemfiles and links it to information from RubyGems. Let people know what gems you use.</p>

<h2 style='clear:both'>The Weebeteurs</h2><img alt='Weebet Screenshot' src='/images/posts/2010/10/weebet_screenshot.png' style='float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0' />
<p>A social-oriented game of sporting event predicitions and wagers. Compete against your friends or the entire userbase. Rise to the top by winning points for your predictions and wagering those points to further raise your score.</p>

<p><a href='http://railsrumble.com/teams/the-weebeteurs'>Team Page</a> <a href='http://wee-bet.com/'>The App</a></p>

<p>Come congratulate the teams in person and join us for drinks at tomorrow&#8217;s YEGRB meetup. We&#8217;ll be talking about javascript before heading out for beers. Meet us at 18:30 at Axis Cafe on the south side of Jasper Ave between 104th street and 103rd. <a href='https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dEpKWl9jVDFsUHNHa1lJaWRqLXlBVmc6MA#gid=0'>RSVP here</a>.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This month we&#8217;re taking a break from Ruby to talk about&#8230; JavaScript!</p>

<p>Javascript is a topic of interest to many Rubyists, and we decided that there&#8217;s enough going on to warrant it&#8217;s own meetup.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already got speakers talking about Node.js and TDD in Javascript, but there are lots of other things to cover. If you&#8217;d like to do a talk then contact @yegrb on Twitter or email mark@yegrb.com.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also still looking for a sponsor for this months meetup. Sponsoring a meetup is as cheap as $100 and ensures we can keep these meetups going at the current venue. Contact mark@yegrb.com if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone that came out for <span class="caps">YEGRB</span> 0.4 with Aman Gupta.  Aman gave a detailed talk on understanding the performance of your Ruby applications, with lots of examples to show how to do this in different situations.  He kindly let us record this talk, and you can watch what was recorded on our <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/7687745">ustream.tv page</a>.

He also <a href="http://github.com/tmm1">shares code on GitHub</a>, and answers questions sent to <a href="http://twitter.com/tmm1">@tmm1 on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>We also tried out Axis Cafe as a new venue.  A big thanks goes out to <a href="http://yardsticksoftware.com">Yardstick Software</a> for sponsoring the space (and the bar tab!).  <a href="http://burmis.ca">Burmis Studio</a> also donated a gift for the presenter.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/posts/2010/06/aman_gupta.png" style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0;" alt="Aman Gupta" />It&#8217;s hard to believe we&#8217;re already on to our fourth <span class="caps">YEGRB</span> meetup, and this is going to be the best one yet!  Aman Gupta (<a href="http://github.com/tmm1">github</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tmm1">twitter</a>) will be joining us via the web to present &#8220;Debugging Ruby: understanding and troubleshooting the VM and your application&#8221;.  Aman is a serial entrepreneur, ruby hacker and a recent winner of a Ruby Heroes award. He currently maintains the EventMachine project and various other gems that help build high-performance distributed and asynchronous systems in ruby, including em-mysql, em-spec, jsSocket and amqp.</p>
<p>Most recently, Aman has been hacking on performance improvements to <span class="caps">MRI</span>, and tools for the VM such as perftools.rb, a sampling profiler for ruby code based on google-perftools, and gdb.rb, a <span class="caps">MRI</span> specific version of gdb.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve setup a <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=c9f4">Google Moderator channel to collect questions for Aman</a> in advance of his talk.  Submit your questions early and vote on the ones you&#8217;re most interested in so that we make maximum use of his time.  You can also record a YouTube video of yourself asking your question.</p>
<p>The meetup will be taking place on June 15th @ 18:30 <span class="caps">MST</span>.  Please <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/yegrb.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dHhCUmZxSzlmbFJCeGZ0MWtLcXNib2c6MA#gid=0"><span class="caps">RSVP</span> in advance</a>.  We&#8217;re making some special arrangements for this months venue and will announce the location details later on this week.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who came out to our meetup last week.  It wasn&#8217;t our biggest meetup, but it was a good one!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/2010/05/P5090027.JPG" alt="The hackup"/></p>
<p>On the housekeeping side we did a quick wrap-up of the first hackup.  It went well, and though lots of new projects were started it will be a few weeks before we&#8217;ve got anything to show for.  Keep your eye on the <a href="http://github.com/yegrb"><span class="caps">YEGRB</span> Github account</a> where some of the hackup projects call home!  Planning for the next hackup has started and we should be ready to make an announcement in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also moved our meetup to the third Tuesday of every month, where it should be staying.  Mark the third Tuesday of your calendar or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=yegrb.com_4pmb3hc3jv4jc75jhodv6m2rkc%40group.calendar.google.com">calendar feed<a/>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Registration for the our first hackup is now open!  For the uninitiated a hackup is similair to one of our meetups, but we replace the talking with hacking!  <span class="caps">YEGRB</span> supplies a venue, power, and internet so all you need to do is come out.  Each participant gets one minute to introduce themselves and pitch an idea or project they&#8217;d like to hack on.  After the pitches are done we break and start hacking on whatever project sounded most interesting to you.  Even better we&#8217;ll be providing free pizza for lunch!</p>
<p>The hackup is happening this Saturday from 10am-5pm at <span class="caps">ENTS</span> (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=10575+114th+Street+Edmonton,+AB+T5H+3J6+(ENTS)&sll=53.627208,-113.518526&sspn=0.006057,0.01929&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=10575+114+St+NW,+Edmonton,+Division+No.+11,+Alberta+T5H+3J7,+Canada&z=15">map</a>).  Unlike the meetup, spaces at the hackup are limited so <a href="http://bit.ly/baiwqR">register now</a> to avoid dissapointment.  If you&#8217;re looking for project ideas check out our <a href="/hacklist/">hacklist</a>!</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="caps">YEGRB</span> is excited to host Edmonton&#8217;s first Ruby Hackup on May 8th from 10am-5pm.</p>
<p>The hackup, unlike our meetups, is a communal coding event where members have one minute to pitch their idea and describe their interests to the rest of the group.  After that we break and people can collaborate as they like.  We provide a venue, along with internet and power.  We&#8217;re hoping this will become a regular event.</p>
<p>Space for our first hackup is limited to fifteen people.  The registration will go up later this week on a first-come first-serve basis.  Watch <a href="http://twitter.com/yegrb">our twitter account</a> for the announcement!</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve just found out the next DemoCamp is going to be happening on May 4th.  As most of our members (myself included) are attending DemoCamp we&#8217;ve decided to move the next RubyMeetup to May 18th.  As well, to prevent this problem in the future we&#8217;ve agreed to schedule all our RubyMeetups going forward on the third Tuesday of every month.  We&#8217;ve already added these future dates to <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/yegrb.com/embed?title=YEGRB%20-%20Edmonton%20Rubyist%20Calendar&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=yegrb.com_4pmb3hc3jv4jc75jhodv6m2rkc@group.calendar.google.com&amp;color=%23A32929&amp;ctz=America/Edmonton">our calendar</a>, so talk your loved ones and clear your schedules in advance!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks again to everyone that came out to <span class="caps">YEGRB</span> 0.2.  We had an even bigger turnout than last time with lots of new faces, as well as people coming back from the last meeting.</p>
<p>We heard the feedback from last time and kept things moving along at quick pace.  Thanks to our great speakers we were able to achieve this goal and wrapped on schedule with time left to go to Pub 1905 for a few drinks.</p>
<p>The talks themselves where great and started off with Chris Brulak (<a href="http://twitter.com/cbrulak">cbrulak</a>) presenting on <a href="http://elxn41.ca/home/login_to_beta">Elxn41.ca</a>.  Chris&#8217; application provides a platform for participants to debate and follow the political issues of the day.  This discussion is meant to be interactive, and emphasise a dialog between members.  Chris contrasted the conversation that happens on Elxn41.ca with a service such as Twitter where participants shout into a crowded space.  In developing Elxn41.ca Chris used a number of popular gems including <a href="http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic">authlogic</a> and <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_versioned">acts_as_versioned</a>.  He tried the Twitter authentication component in authlogic but decided to use the <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth">twitter-auth gem</a> for authentication in it&#8217;s place.  If you&#8217;d like to try this application just visit <a href="http://elxn41.ca">http://elxn41.ca</a> and login with the beta password &#8216;democracyrocks&#8217;.  Chris is actively looking for developers to help build out the Elxn41.ca feature set.  If you&#8217;d like to help out contact him at <a href="mailto:elxn41@elxn41.ca">elxn41@elxn41.ca</a>.</p>
<p>The next speaker was Sean Ouimet (<a href="http://twitter.com/skepticsean">@skepticsean</a>) presenting on <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> and <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>.  Sean walked everyone through the basics of Sinatra, including how to create a web application and declared your routes and the code which handles them.  He then moved into some more advanced Sinatra scenarios.  In particular his demonstrtation of how to embed multiple Sinatra apps in a single Rack application was intriqing as it can be used to deploy Rails and Sinatra in the same application.  We&#8217;ve included Sean&#8217;s slides below if you&#8217;d like to see his code again.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://docs.google.com/present/embed?id=dgkmpgvz_448kdmvkd8&size=m" frameborder="0" width="555" height="451"></iframe></p>
<p>Our last lightning talk was by Mark Bennett (<a href="http://twitter.com/markbennett">@MarkBennett</a>).  He presented a new gem he&#8217;d written called <a href="http://wiki.github.com/MarkBennett/adman/">Adman</a> which makes it easy to share your Sinatra or Rails application using Bonjour (aka Zeroconf).  With Adman anyone can find and resolve your applications IP automatically without using a <span class="caps">DNS</span> server or publishing your IP in advance.  This is especially useful at hackups, conferences, or RailsCamps where access to the Internet is limited.  If you&#8217;d like to try Adman for yourself just run, &#8220;gem install adman&#8221;.  Check out <a href="http://github.com/MarkBennett/adman">Adman on GitHub</a> and <a href="http://wiki.github.com/MarkBennett/adman/">read the wiki</a> for more details.  Adman is under active development, and Mark want&#8217;s to make using Bonjour in your app a one liner.</p>
<p>With the lighting talks wrapped up on time some of the attendees with iPad&#8217;s kindly demonstrated them for the rest of the group.  Reg Cheramy (<a href="http://twitter.com/rcheramy">@rcheramy</a>) from <a href="http://www.edistorm.com/">Edistorm</a> demonstrated some of his favourite features and apps already running on the iPad as well as some development work he&#8217;s done with the iPad.  He wasn&#8217;t the only one with an iPad as Cam Linke and another attendee also brought their iPads out.  Thanks guys, the iPad looks like it&#8217;s going to be another winner for Apple.  Can&#8217;t wait to order mine at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Thanks again to all the attendees who made it out to this months meetup.  Our primary mission is to connect local Ruby enthusiasts, so seeing how well attended the meetups have been is really encouraging.  I know there are still lots of you out there who haven&#8217;t made it out to an event yet, but we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you at <span class="caps">YEGRB</span> 0.3.  Also watch for us to explore new ways of connecting the Ruby community in the coming months.</p>]]></description>
